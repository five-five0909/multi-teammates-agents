## 2026-08-07 — cross-CLI orchestration milestone

- Initialized Git on `main` and committed executable Expert Team orchestration as
  `e6ddfba`.
- Local evidence: 74 unit/simulated tests, mypy over 38 files, both plugin
  validators, agent drift validation, and no-model Codex/Claude probes pass.
- Kept the Trellis task active: model-backed cross-host E2E and the remaining
  permission/gate/integrity/crash matrices still require evidence.


## Session 1: Implement Expert Team CLI narrative console

**Date**: 2026-08-08
**Task**: Implement Expert Team CLI narrative console
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Added terminal-first public narrative rendering for managed Expert Team runs. Integrated the same projection into the MCP expert_team_run text response and local runner, with quiet/json compatibility, manager metadata, audit/rework visibility, Trellis references, privacy redaction, tests, and plugin contract documentation. Full tests, mypy, contract fixtures, Claude agent rendering, host probes, and Codex existing-run smoke passed.
